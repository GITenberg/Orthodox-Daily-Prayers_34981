<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>THE PRAYERBOOK</h3>
<p>The present Prayerbook contains the most
basic daily prayers of the Orthodox Christian
as they have been transmitted to us essentially
by the Russian Church, although the other
Orthodox Traditions in this matter are very
similar.</p>
<p>In this book, we will find the Psalms of the
Holy Prophet King David, the prayer which
Our Lord Himself taught His holy disciples,
prayers of the desert fathers, prayers of the
great hierarchs and teachers of the Church, as
well as the prayers of more recent fathers.</p>
<p>The publication of such prayers does not
limit the free expression of the Christian
soul to the Creator, the Most-holy Theotokos
and the Saints. On the contrary, by reading
these prayers we learn how to pray. They
become models for our own, personal prayers.
Often, we would like to pray but, distracted by
the bustling world around us, or troubled by
fear or sorrow, we do not even know how to
begin. We then begin with the Prayerbook
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
and find that not only much of what we wanted
to say is included in the prayers of the fathers,
but that afterwards, we find words of our own
to continue the outpouring of our soul.</p>
<p>There is yet another gift in the Prayerbook.
As Orthodox Christians we are all members of
the same Body. We express and partake of
that oneness in the services of the Church,
especially in the Divine Liturgy. Through the
Prayerbook, this oneness is brought into our
homes or any place that an Orthodox Christian
reads it. Our own prayers are carried to the
Throne of God on the wings of prayers that
have been used by the People of God for centuries.
We no longer pray alone.</p>
<h3>THE RULE OF PRAYER</h3>
<p>Many rules of prayer have developed in the
history of the Church. At no place or time has
there been a uniform rule. In 19th Century
Russia, for example, the rule varied considerably
from one monastery to another,
though certain basic elements were found in all
of them. Therefore, the term &ldquo;Rule of Prayer&rdquo;
should never be understood as a strait jacket,
regulating and limiting our communion with
God.</p>
<p>What the Rules do teach us is the importance
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of regularity in our life of prayer. It is
better to say a few prayers every day without
fail than to say a great number of prayers on an
irregular, impulsive basis. Those of us who are
fortunate enough to have a spiritual father
should consult him before establishing our own
Rule. Those of us who do not, should begin
with a modest Rule, increasing it only when it
has become a regular and integral part of our
lives.</p>
<h3>THE TRANSLATION</h3>
<p>We have attempted to use a contemporary
but dignified form of the English language
throughout this present translation. Wherever
possible, existing translations of the Orthodox
Church in America have been used. For example,
the Prayers in Preparation for Holy Communion
are taken from the official Divine
Liturgy book (St. Tikhon&rsquo;s Seminary Press,
1977) with very few changes. The Psalms,
verses, troparia, and prayers not included in
that edition have now been translated and included
to complete the traditional order.</p>
<p>The Psalms are taken from the Revised Standard
Version of the Bible with changes made
wherever significant differences with the Orthodox
liturgical Psalter (based on the Septuagint)
made it necessary. The numbering of
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the Psalms follows the Septuagint throughout
the Prayerbook. We are leaving to Biblical
scholars the study of the merits of the various
texts of the Holy Scriptures. Our object here is
to provide the English-speaking Orthodox
Christian with a Prayerbook as closely
equivalent as possible to the Prayerbooks that
Orthodox Christians of other nationalities
have used for generations.</p>

<h2>MORNING PRAYERS</h2>
<p class="rubric">Having awakened, arise from your bed without
laziness and, having gathered your thoughts, make
the Sign of the Cross, saying:</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
<p class="rubric">Afterwards, stand in silence for a few moments
until all your senses are calmed. At that point, make
three prostrations, saying:</p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have
mercy on me, a sinner.</p>
<p class="rubric">Then, begin the Morning Prayers with these
words:</p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, through
the prayers of Thy most pure Mother and
all the saints, have mercy on us. Amen.</p>
<p>Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.</p>
<p>O Heavenly King, the Comforter, the
Spirit of Truth Who art everywhere and
fillest all things. Treasury of Blessings
and Giver of Life: Come and abide in us,
and cleanse us from every impurity, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
save our souls, O Good One.</p>
<p>Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal!
Have mercy on us. <span class="rubric">(3 times)</span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>O Most Holy Trinity! Have mercy on
us! Lord, cleanse us from our sins!
Master, pardon our transgressions! Holy
One, visit and heal our infirmities for Thy
name&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy! <span class="rubric">(3 times)</span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed
be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread; and
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us; and lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p class="rubric">(If there is a priest, he adds the usual exclamation)</p>
<p>Having arisen from sleep, we fall down
before Thee, O Blessed One, and sing to
Thee, O Mighty One, the angelic hymn:
Holy! Holy! Holy! art Thou, O God;
through the Theotokos, have mercy on us.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p>Having raised me from my bed and from
sleep, O Lord, enlighten my mind and
heart, and open my lips that I may praise
Thee, O Holy Trinity: Holy! Holy! Holy!
art Thou, O God; through the Theotokos,
have mercy on us.</p>
<p>Now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>The Judge will come suddenly and the
acts of every man will be revealed; but in
the middle of the night we cry with fear:
Holy! Holy! Holy! art Thou, O God;
through the Theotokos, have mercy on us.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy! <span class="rubric">(12 times)</span></p>
<p>Having risen from sleep, I thank Thee,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the Holy Trinity. In the abundance of Thy
kindness and long patience, Thou hast not
been angry with me for my laziness and
sinfulness, nor hast Thou destroyed me in
my lawlessness. Instead, in Thy usual love
for mankind, Thou hast raised me as I lay
in despair, that I might rise early and
glorify Thy Reign. Enlighten now the eyes
of my mind and open my lips, that I might
learn of Thy words, understand Thy commandments,
accomplish Thy will, hymn
Thee in heart-felt confession and praise
Thine all-holy name, the Father and the
Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever
and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Come, let us worship God, our King!</p>
<p>Come, let us worship and fall down
before Christ, our King and our God!</p>
<p>Come, let us worship and fall down
before Christ Himself, our King and our
God!</p>

<h3>Psalm 50</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Have mercy on me, O God,</p>
<p class="t2">according to Thy great mercy;</p>
<p class="t0">according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies,</p>
<p class="t2">blot out my transgressions.</p>
<p class="t0">Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,</p>
<p class="t2">and cleanse me from my sin!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For I know my transgressions,</p>
<p class="t2">and my sin is ever before me.</p>
<p class="t0">Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,</p>
<p class="t2">and done that which is evil in Thy sight,</p>
<p class="t0">so that Thou art justified in Thy sentence</p>
<p class="t2">and blameless in Thy judgment.</p>
<p class="t0">Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,</p>
<p class="t2">and in sins did my mother conceive me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Behold, Thou desirest truth in the inward being;</p>
<p class="t2">therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.</p>
<p class="t0">Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p class="t2">wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
<p class="t0">Fill me with joy and gladness;</p>
<p class="t2">let the bones which Thou hast broken rejoice.</p>
<p class="t0">Hide Thy face from my sins,</p>
<p class="t2">and blot out all my iniquities.</p>
<p class="t0">Create in me a clean heart, O God,</p>
<p class="t2">and put a new and right spirit within me.</p>
<p class="t0">Cast me not away from Thy presence,</p>
<p class="t2">and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.</p>
<p class="t0">Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation,</p>
<p class="t2">and uphold me with a willing spirit.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then I will teach transgressors Thy ways,</p>
<p class="t2">and sinners will return to Thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,</p>
<p class="t2">Thou God of my salvation,</p>
<p class="t2">and my tongue will sing aloud of Thy deliverance.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lord, open Thou my lips,</p>
<p class="t2">and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise.</p>
<p class="t0">For Thou hast no delight in sacrifice;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p class="t2">were I to give a burnt offering, Thou wouldst not be pleased.</p>
<p class="t0">The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit;</p>
<p class="t2">a broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Do good to Zion in Thy good pleasure;</p>
<p class="t2">rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="t0">Then wilt Thou delight in right sacrifices,</p>
<p class="t2">in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;</p>
<p class="t2">then bulls will be offered on Thy altar.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Symbol of Faith</h3>
<p>I believe in one God, the Father
Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth,
and of all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, the only-begotten, begotten of the
Father before all ages. Light of Light; true
God of true God; begotten, not made; of
one essence with the Father, by Whom all
things were made; who for us men and for
our salvation came down from Heaven,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and
the Virgin Mary, and became man. And
He was crucified for us under Pontius
Pilate, and suffered, and was buried. And
the third day He arose again, according to
the Scriptures, and ascended into Heaven,
and sits at the right hand of the Father;
and He shall come again with glory to
judge the living and the dead; whose
Kingdom shall have no end.</p>
<p>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the
Giver of Life, Who proceeds from the
Father; Who with the Father and the Son
together is worshipped and glorified; Who
spoke by the prophets. In one Holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I
acknowledge one baptism for the remission
of sins. I look for the resurrection of
the dead, and the life of the world to come.
Amen.</p>
<h4>1st Prayer, by St. Macarius the Great.</h4>
<p>O God, cleanse me a sinner, for I have
done nothing good before Thee. Deliver
me from the evil one, and may Thy will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
in me, that I might open my unworthy lips
without condemnation and praise Thy
holy name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
now and ever and unto ages of ages.
Amen.</p>
<h4>2nd Prayer, by St. Macarius the Great.</h4>
<p>Having risen from sleep, I offer Thee, O
Savior, the midnight song. Falling down, I
cry to Thee: let me not fall asleep in the
death of sin. Be gracious to me, Thou Who
wast willingly crucified. Raise me quickly
as I lie in laziness, and save me as I stand
in prayer. After the night&rsquo;s sleep, O Christ
God, shine a sinless day on me and save
me.</p>
<h4>3rd Prayer, by St. Macarius the Great.</h4>
<p>Having risen from sleep, I run to Thee,
O Master, for Thou lovest mankind, and I
rush to accomplish Thy work. Help me, I
pray Thee, at all times and in all things.
Deliver me from every evil thing of this
world and from works of the devil. Save
me, and lead me into Thine eternal
Kingdom. Thou art my Maker, The Provider
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and Giver of everything good. All
my hope is in Thee and I glorify Thee, now
and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>4th Prayer, by St. Macarius the Great.</h4>
<p>O Lord, through Thy abundant
goodness and great generosity, Thou hast
allowed me, Thy servant, to pass through
the hours of this night untempted by any
evil of the enemy. Grant also, O Master
and Creator of all, that I might accomplish
Thy will in Thy true light and with an illumined
heart, now and ever and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>5th Prayer, by St. Macarius the Great.</h4>
<p>O Lord, the Almighty God, Who acceptest
the thrice-holy hymn from Thy
heavenly hosts: accept this song of the
night even from me, Thine unworthy servant.
Grant that at every year and hour of
my life I might glorify Thee, the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and ever
and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>6th Prayer, by St. Basil the Great.</h4>
<p>Almighty Lord, the God of hosts and of
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
all flesh, Thou livest in the heights, yet
lookest down on the humble, proving the
hearts and emotions, clearly foreknowing
the secrets of men. Thou art the Light
without beginning, in Whom there is no
variation nor shadow of change. O Immortal
King, accept the prayers which we
now offer Thee from defiled lips. Free us
from the sins we have committed in deed,
word or thought, knowingly and unknowingly.
Cleanse us from all defilement of
flesh and spirit. Grant us to pass through
the entire night of this present life with a
watchful heart and a sober mind, awaiting
the coming of the bright and manifest day
of Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, God
and Savior Jesus Christ, when the Judge
of all will come with glory to reward each
according to his deeds. May we not be
found fallen and lazy, but alert and roused
to action, prepared to enter into His joy
and the divine chamber of His glory,
where the voice of those who feast is
unceasing and indescribable is the delight
of those who behold the inexpressible
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
beauty of Thy countenance. For Thou art
the true Light which enlightens and sanctifies
all, and all creation hymns Thee unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>7th Prayer, also by St. Basil.</h4>
<p>We bless Thee, most high God and Lord
of mercies, Who ever doest great and unfathomable
things for us&mdash;glorious and
awesome things without number. Thou
givest us sleep for the repose of our frailty,
relieving the labors of our over-burdened
flesh. We thank Thee for not destroying
us in our lawlessness. Instead, Thou hast
shown Thy usual love for mankind, and
raised us, as we lay in despair, to glorify
Thy Reign. Therefore, we implore Thy
boundless goodness: enlighten our
thoughts and eyes, and awaken our minds
from the heavy sleep of laziness. Open our
lips and fill them with Thy praise, that we
may unwaveringly hymn and confess
Thee, the God glorified in all and by all,
Father without beginning, with Thine
only-begotten Son and Thine all-holy,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and
unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<h4>9th Prayer, to Our Lord Jesus Christ.</h4>
<p>My most merciful and all-merciful God,
O Lord Jesus Christ! In Thy great love,
Thou didst come down and become flesh in
order to save all. Again, I pray Thee, save
me by Grace! If Thou shouldst save me
because of my deeds, it would not be a
gift, but merely a duty. Truly, Thou
aboundest in graciousness and art inexpressibly
merciful! Thou hast said, O my
Christ: &ldquo;He who believes in me shall live
and never see death&rdquo;. If faith in Thee
saves the desperate, behold: I believe!
Save me, for Thou art my God and my
Maker. May my faith replace my deeds, O
my God, for Thou wilt find no deeds to
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
justify me. May my faith be sufficient for
all. May it answer for me; may it justify
me; may it make me a partaker of Thine
eternal glory; and may Satan not seize me,
O Word, and boast that He has torn me
from Thy hand and fold. O Christ my
Savior: save me whether I want it or not!
Come quickly, hurry, for I perish! Thou
art my God from my mother&rsquo;s womb.
Grant, O Lord, that I may now love Thee
as once I loved sin, and that I may labor
for Thee without laziness as once I labored
for Satan the deceiver. Even more, I will
labor for Thee, my Lord and God Jesus
Christ, all the days of my life, now and
ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>10th Prayer, to the Angel, the guardian of human life.</h4>
<p>O Holy Angel, who stand by my wretched
soul and my passionate life: do not
abandon me, a sinner, neither depart from
me because of my lack of self-control.
Leave no room for the evil demon to gain
control of me through the violence of this
mortal body. Strengthen my weak and feeble
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hand, and instruct me in the path of
salvation. O holy Angel of God, the guardian
and protector of my wretched soul
and body: forgive all the sorrows I have
caused you, every day of my life. If I have
sinned in this past night, protect me during
this day. Keep me from every adverse
temptation, that I may not anger God by
any sin. Pray to the Lord for me, that He
may establish me in His fear and make me,
His servant, worthy of His goodness.
Amen.</p>
<h4>11th Prayer, to the Most Holy Theotokos.</h4>
<p>O Most Holy Theotokos, my Lady:
through your holy and all-powerful
prayers, turn away from me, your humble
and unworthy servant, despair, forgetfulness,
unreasonableness, indifference,
and all unclean, evil and blasphemous
thoughts from my wretched heart and
darkened mind. Extinguish the flame of
my passions, for I am poor and wretched.
Deliver me from my numerous and wicked
memories and fantasies. Free me from all
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
evil acts, for you are blessed by all generations,
and your most honorable name is
glorified unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>

of Grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are
you among women and blessed is the fruit
of your womb, for you have borne the
Savior of our souls!</p>
<p>Most glorious Ever-Virgin Mother of
Christ our God, bear our prayer to your
Son and our God, that through you He
may save our souls.</p>
<p>O heavenly hosts of holy Angels and
Archangels, pray for us sinners.</p>
<p>O glorious Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs,
and all Saints, pray for us sinners.</p>
<p>Pray to God for me holy ________ (your
Patron Saint), for with fervor I run to you,
swift helper and intercessor for my soul!</p>

preserve Thy habitation.</p>
<p>It is truly meet to bless you, O

honorable than the Cherubim, and more

Prayer of the Last Elders of Optina&rdquo; with their

spiritual tranquility. Grant that I may fully
surrender myself to Thy holy Will.</p>
<p>At every hour of this day, direct and
support me in all things. Whatsoever news
may reach me in the course of the day,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
teach me to accept it with a calm soul and
the firm conviction that all is subject to
Thy holy Will.</p>
<p>Direct my thoughts and feelings in all
my words and actions. In all unexpected
occurrences, do not let me forget that all is
sent down from Thee.</p>
<p>Grant that I may deal straightforwardly
and wisely with every member of my family,
neither embarrassing nor saddening
anyone.</p>
<p>O Lord, grant me the strength to endure
the fatigue of the coming day and all the
events that take place during it. Direct my
will and teach me to pray, to believe, to
hope, to be patient, to forgive, and to love.

<h3>The Symbol of Faith</h3>
<p>I believe in one God, the Father
almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and
of all things visible and invisible.</p>
<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, the only-begotten, begotten of the
Father before all ages. Light of Light; true
God of true God; begotten, not made; of
one essence with the Father, by whom all
things were made; who for us men and for
our salvation came down from heaven, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the
Virgin Mary, and became man. And He
was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate,
and suffered, and was buried. And the
third day He rose again, according to the
Scriptures, and ascended into heaven, and
sits at the right hand of the Father; and
He shall come again with glory to judge
the living and the dead; whose Kingdom
shall have no end.</p>
<p>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the
Giver of Life, who proceeds from the
Father; who with the Father and the Son
together is worshipped and glorified; who
spoke by the prophets. In one Holy,
Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I
acknowledge one baptism for the remission
of sins. I look for the resurrection of
the dead, and the life of the world to come.
Amen.</p>

(See page 119).</p>

praises. For you, O Forerunner, the
witness of the Lord is sufficient. You truly
showed yourself more honorable than the
prophets, for you were made worthy to
baptize in the streams the One Whom you
proclaimed. Having gladly suffered for

Himself in the flesh, taken away the sin of

<h3>Saturday Evening</h3>
<p class="rubric">The Sunday Troparia and Kontakia are read, according
to the Tone of the week.</p>
<h4>Tone 1</h4>
<p>When the stone had been sealed by the
Jews; while the soldiers were guarding
Thy most pure Body; Thou didst rise on
the third day, O Savior, granting life to
the world. The powers of heaven therefore
cried to Thee, O Giver of Life: Glory to
Thy resurrection, O Christ! Glory to Thy
Kingdom! Glory to Thy dispensation, O
Thou who lovest mankind.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="t2">now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
</div>
<p>As God, Thou didst rise from the tomb
in glory, raising the world with Thyself.
Human nature praises Thee as God, for
death has vanished! Adam exults, O
Master! Eve rejoices, for she is freed from
bondage, and cries to Thee: Thou art the
Giver of Resurrection to all, O Christ!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h4>Tone 2</h4>
<p>When Thou didst descend to death, O
Life Immortal, Thou didst slay hell with
the splendor of Thy Godhead! And when
from the depths Thou didst raise the dead,
all the powers of heaven cried out: O Giver
of Life! Christ our God! Glory to Thee!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<p>Hell became afraid, O Almighty Savior,
seeing the miracle of Thy resurrection
from the tomb! The dead arose! Creation,
with Adam, beheld this and rejoiced with
Thee! And the world, O my Savior, praises
Thee forever.</p>
<h4>Tone 3</h4>
<p>Let the heavens rejoice! Let the earth be
glad! For the Lord has shown strength
with His arm! He has trampled down
death by death! He has become the firstborn
of the dead! He has delivered us from
the depths of hell, and has granted the
world great mercy!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<p>On this day Thou didst rise from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
tomb, O Merciful One, leading us from the
gates of death. On this day Adam exults
as Eve rejoices; with the prophets and
patriarchs they unceasingly praise the
divine majesty of Thy power!</p>
<h4>Tone 4</h4>
<p>When the women disciples of the Lord
learned from the angel the joyous message
of Thy Resurrection; they cast away the
ancestral curse and elatedly told the
apostles: Death is overthrown! Christ
God is risen, granting the world great mercy.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<p>My Savior and Redeemer as God rose
from the tomb and delivered the earthborn
from their chains. He has shattered the
gates of hell, and as Master, He has risen
on the third day!</p>
<h4>Tone 5</h4>
<p>Let us, the faithful, praise and worship
the Word, coeternal with the Father and
the Spirit, born for our salvation from the
Virgin; for He willed to be lifted up on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Cross in the flesh, to endure death, and to
raise the dead by His glorious Resurrection.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<p>Thou didst descend into hell, O my
Savior, shattering its gates as Almighty;
resurrecting the dead as Creator, and
destroying the sting of death. Thou hast
delivered Adam from the curse, O Lover of
Man, and we all cry to Thee: O Lord, save
us!</p>
<h4>Tone 6</h4>
<p>The angelic powers were at Thy tomb;
the guards became as dead men. Mary
stood by Thy grave, seeking Thy most
pure Body. Thou didst capture hell, not
being tempted by it. Thou didst come to
the Virgin, granting life. O Lord who didst
rise from the dead: glory to Thee!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<p>When Christ God, the Giver of Life,
raised all of the dead from the valleys of
misery with His mighty hand, He bestowed
resurrection on the human race. He is
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the Savior of all, the Resurrection, the
Life, and the God of all.</p>
<h4>Tone 7</h4>
<p>By Thy Cross, Thou didst destroy
death! To the thief, Thou didst open
Paradise! For the myrrhbearers, Thou
didst change weeping into joy! And Thou
didst command Thy disciples, O Christ
God, to proclaim that Thou art risen,
granting the world great mercy!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<p>The dominion of death can no longer
hold men captive, for Christ descended,
shattering and destroying its powers! Hell
is bound, while the prophets rejoice and
cry: The Savior has come to those in faith!
Enter, you faithful, into the Resurrection!</p>
<h4>Tone 8</h4>
<p>Thou didst descend from on high, O
Merciful One! Thou didst accept the three-day
burial to free us from our sufferings!
O Lord, our Life and Resurrection: glory
to Thee!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Glory to the Father.... Now and ever....</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>By rising from the tomb, Thou didst
raise the dead and resurrect Adam. Eve
exults in Thy Resurrection, and the world
celebrates Thy rising from the dead, O
greatly Merciful One!</p>

<h3>Prayer to the Most Holy Theotokos
<br /><span class="subttl">by the Monk Paul</span></h3>
<p>O undefiled, immaculate, incorrupt and
most pure Lady, the pure Virgin Bride of
God! Through your most glorious birth-giving,
you united God the Word to
mankind and joined our fallen human
nature to the heavenly. You are the only
hope of the hopeless, the aid of the embattled
a ready help to those who run to you
and a refuge for all Christians. Do not turn
away from me who am sinful and vile,
even though I have made myself totally
useless through defiled thoughts, words
and deeds, and my mind has become
enslaved to the lazy pleasures of this life.
As Mother of the God Who loves
mankind, have pity on me, a prodigal sinner,
in that same love for mankind.
Receive the prayer I offer to you with
defiled lips and pray to your Son, our
Master and Lord, with your maternal
boldness. May He open even to me the
goodness of His deep love for mankind.
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
May He overlook my countless transgressions,
turn me to repentance and make me
an experienced accomplisher of His commandments.
Stand by me always in your
mercy, compassion and love of good. Be
my fervent intercessor and help in this
life, driving off the assaults of enemies
and guiding me to salvation. Guard my
wretched soul at the time of my death,
driving away the dark forms of the evil
demons. Deliver me from eternal torments
at the Day of Judgment and reveal me an
heir of the inexpressible glory of your Son
and our God. May I receive this, my Lady
most glorious Theotokos, through your
help and intercession: through the Grace
and love for mankind of your only-begotten
Son, our Lord, God and Savior
Jesus Christ, to Whom belong all glory,
honor and worship, with His Father Who
is without beginning, and His most holy,
good and life-creating Spirit, now and
ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<h3>A Prayer to Our Lord Jesus Christ
<br /><span class="subttl">by the Monk Antiochus</span></h3>
<p>As we prepare for sleep, Master, grant
rest to our bodies and souls. Keep us from
the dark sleep of sin and from every dark
and passionate pleasure of the night. Still
the impulses of passions and put out the
flaming arrows which the Evil One looses
deceitfully against us. Still the rebellions
of the flesh and put to sleep our worldly
and material reasonings. O God, grant us
an alert mind, chaste thoughts, a sober
heart, and a light sleep, free of every
satanic dream. Raise us at the time of
prayer confirmed in Thy commandments&mdash;the
memory of Thy judgments firmly in
us. Grant that we may glorify Thee
throughout this night, singing, blessing
and glorifying Thy most honorable and
majestic name: the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<h4>1st Prayer, to God the Father,
<br />by St. Macarius the Great</h4>
<p>O Eternal God and King of all Creation,
Who hast granted me to reach this hour:
forgive the sins I have committed this day
in deed, word and thought. Cleanse, O
Lord, my humble soul from every defilement
of flesh and spirit. Grant, Lord, that
I may pass through this night in peace.
When I rise from my humble bed, may I
please Thy most holy Name all the days of
my life and trample under foot the
physical and bodiless enemies that wage
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
war against me. Deliver me, Lord, from
vain thoughts which defile me and from
evil lusts. For Thine is the Kingdom and
the Power and the Glory, of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now
and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>2nd Prayer, to Our Lord Jesus Christ
<br />by St. Antiochus</h4>
<p>Almighty Word of the Father, Jesus
Christ, Who art perfect: never abandon
me, Thy servant, for Thy great mercy&rsquo;s
sake, but ever abide in me. O Jesus, Good
Shepherd of Thy sheep, do not deliver me
to the serpent&rsquo;s rebellion! Do not abandon
me to Satan&rsquo;s will, for the seed of corruption
is within me! Instead, O Lord God the
Adored, Holy King Jesus Christ, keep me
while I sleep by Thy unwavering Light,
Thy Holy Spirit by Whom Thou didst
sanctify Thy disciples. O Lord, grant to
me, Thine unworthy servant, salvation on
my bed. Enlighten my mind with the light
of understanding Thy Holy Gospel; my
soul with the love of Thy Cross; my heart
with the purity of Thy Word; my body
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
with Thy passionless Passion. Keep my
thoughts with Thy humility and raise me
at the right time to glorify Thee. For Thou
art most glorified, with Thine unoriginate
Father and Thy most Holy Spirit forever.
Amen.</p>
<h4>3rd Prayer, to the Holy Spirit</h4>
<p>O Lord, the Heavenly King, the Comforter,
the Spirit of Truth: have compassion
and mercy on me, Thy sinful servant!
Absolve me, who am unworthy. Forgive
all the sins I have committed this day
both in my humanity and my inhumanity,
behaving worse than beasts in sins voluntary
and involuntary, known and
unknown, from my youth, from evil suggestions,
haste and despondency. If I
have sworn by Thy name or blasphemed it
in thought; if I have reproached anyone or
become angered by something; or
slandered or saddened anyone in my
anger; or have lied, or slept unnecessarily;
or a beggar has come to me and I have
despised him; or have saddened by
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
brother or quarrelled with him; or have
judged someone; or have allowed myself
to become haughty, proud or angry; or,
when standing in prayer, my mind has
been shaken by the wickedness of this
world; or have entertained depraved
thoughts; or have over-eaten, over-drunk
or laughed mindlessly; or have had evil
thoughts or seen the beauty of someone
and been wounded by it in my heart; or
have spoken inappropriately; or have
laughed at my brother&rsquo;s sins when my
own transgressions are countless; or have
been indifferent to prayer; or have done
any other evil that I can not remember&mdash;for
I have done all this and more: have
mercy, O Master, my Creator, on me, Thy
despondent and unworthy servant! Absolve,
remit and forgive me, in Thy
goodness and love for mankind, that I,
who am prodigal, sinful and wretched,
may lie down in peace and find sleep and
rest. May I worship, hymn and praise Thy
most honorable Name, with the Father
and His only-begotten Son, now and ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>4th Prayer, of St. Macarius the Great</h4>
<p>What can I bring Thee? With what can I
repay Thee, O Immortal King, the
bestower of great gifts, O generous Lord,
the Lover of mankind? Though I have
been lazy in pleasing Thee and have done
no good, Thou hast brought me to the end
of this day, ordering the conversion and
salvation of my soul. Be merciful towards
me, a sinner devoid of any good deeds.
Raise up my fallen soul, defiled by immeasurable
sins. Remove from me every
evil thought of this visible life. Forgive, O
only Sinless One, all the sins I have committed
against Thee this day, in
knowledge or in ignorance, in word, deed
or thought or through any of my senses.
Covering me Thyself, protect me from
every assault of the enemy through Thy
divine Power, inexpressible Love for
mankind and Strength. Cleanse, O God,
cleanse the multitude of my sins. Be pleased,
O Lord, to deliver me from the snares
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
of the Evil One, and save my passionate
soul. When Thou comest in glory, illumine
me with the light of Thy countenance.
May I fall uncondemned into a sleep free
of apparitions. Keep the thoughts of Thy
servant untroubled, and keep far from me
every satanic activity. Enlighten the
reason-endowed eyes of my heart, that I
fall not into the sleep of death. Send to me
an angel of peace, the guide and guardian
of my soul and body, that he may deliver
me from my enemies. Then, when I arise
from my bed, I shall offer Thee prayers of
thanksgiving. Yea, Lord, hear me, Thy
sinful servant, impoverished in will and
conscience. Grant that I may learn from
Thy words when I arise. Cause Thy
Angels to drive demonic despondency far
from me. May I bless Thy holy Name and
praise and glorify Mary, the most pure
Theotokos, whom Thou hast given to us
sinners as an intercessor. Receive her as
she prays for us. We know that she imitates
Thy love for mankind and never
ceases to pray. Through her intercessions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the Sign of the Precious Cross and for the
sake of all Thy saints, O Jesus Christ our
God, have mercy on my wretched soul, for
Thou art Holy and most glorified unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>5th Prayer</h4>
<p>O Lord our God, forgive all the sins I
have committed this day in word, deed
and thought, for Thou art good and lovest
mankind. Grant me a peaceful sleep, free
of restlessness. Send Thy Guardian Angel
to protect and keep me from all harm. For
Thou art the Guardian of our souls and
bodies, and to Thee we ascribe glory, to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the
Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of
ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>6th Prayer</h4>
<p>O Lord our God, in Whom we believe
and upon Whose Name we call more than
any other name: grant relief to our souls
and bodies as we go to sleep. Keep us from
every fantasy and dark pleasure. Halt the
rushing of passions and quench the fiery
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
arousals of the flesh. Grant us to live
chastely in word and deed. Having embraced
a virtuous life, may we not fall
away from Thy promised blessings, for
blessed art Thou for ever. Amen.</p>

O Lord my Creator, Who desirest not the

<h4>9th Prayer, to the Most Holy Theotokos,
<br />by Peter, the Studite monk</h4>
<p>Before you, the Most Pure Mother of
God, I who am wretched fall down and
pray: you know, O Queen that I sin constantly
and anger your Son and my God.
No matter how often I repent, I appear a
liar before God, and repent with trembling.
Can God shake me and I do those
same things again an hour later? Knowing
this, my Mistress, O Lady Theotokos, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
pray: have mercy on me, strengthen me
and grant that I may do good. You know,
my Lady Theotokos, that I abhor my evil
deeds and love the Law of my God with all
my mind. But, most pure Lady, I do not
know how I can love what I abhor and
turn away from what is good. Do not allow
my will to be done, Most Pure One, for it is
not appropriate. May the will of your Son
and my God be done. May He save and
enlighten me, and give me the Grace of
His Holy Spirit, in order that I might stop
sinning from this time on and live the remainder
of my life in obedience to your
Son, to Whom belongs all glory, honor and
majesty, with His Father Who is without
beginning, and His Most Holy, good and

protector of my soul and body: forgive me
for all the sins I have committed this day.
Deliver me from all the evil of my militant
Enemy, that I may not anger my God by
any sin. Pray for me, your sinful and unworthy
servant, that you may show me
worthy of the goodness and mercy of the
All-Holy Trinity, the Mother of my Lord
Jesus Christ and all the Saints. Amen.</p>
<h4>Then this Kontakion to the Theotokos</h4>

Amen.</p>
<h4>A Prayer of St. John of Damascus,
<br />said pointing at the bed</h4>
<p>O Master Who lovest mankind, is this
bed to be my coffin? Or wilt Thou
enlighten my wretched soul with another
day? Behold: before me lies the coffin,
before me stands death! O Lord, I fear
Thy judgment and the endless torments,
yet I cease not to do evil. I always anger
Thee, my Lord God, and Thy most pure
Mother, all the heavenly hosts and my
holy Guardian Angel. I know, Lord, that I
am unworthy of Thy love for mankind. Indeed,
I am worthy of every condemnation
and torment. Yet, Lord, save me whether I
want it or not! When Thou savest the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
righteous, it is no great thing. When Thou
hast mercy on the pure, it causes no
wonder, for they are worthy of Thy mercy.
Astound us with Thy mercy towards me, a
sinner. Reveal in this manner Thy love for
mankind, that my wickedness may not
overcome Thine inexpressible goodness
and mercy. As Thou wilt, order my life!</p>
<p class="rubric">Wishing to lie down on your bed, say:</p>
<p>Enlighten my eyes, Christ&mdash;God, that
I fall not asleep to death and that my
enemy may not say of me: I have overcome
him.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p>Be the Helper of my soul, O God, for I
walk among many snares. Deliver me from
them, O Good One, and save me, for Thou
lovest mankind.</p>
<p>Now and ever and unto ages of ages.
Amen.</p>
<p>Let us ever hymn the most glorious
Mother of God, who is holier than the
Holy Angels. With heart and lips let us

truly bore God incarnate for us and prays
ceaselessly for our souls.</p>
<p class="rubric">Kiss your Cross. Then, make the Sign of the Cross
over your bed, from head to foot and either side,
saying the Prayer to the Precious Cross:</p>
<p>Let God arise and let His enemies be
scattered! Let those who hate Him flee
from before His face! As smoke vanishes,
so let them vanish. As wax melts before
the fire, so let sinners perish before the
face of those who love God and sign
themselves with the Sign of the Cross and
say joyfully: rejoice, most precious and
life-creating Cross of the Lord, which
chases demons away through the power of
our Lord Jesus Christ Who was nailed to
you, descended into hell and, having
trampled down the power of the devil,
gave to us His precious Cross for the
routing of all enemies. Help me for ever,
most precious and life-creating Cross of
the Lord, with the Holy Lady Virgin
Theotokos and all the Saints. Amen.</p>
<p>Remit, absolve and forgive, O God, all
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>

mercy, according to Thy great mercy, on
those who have asked us to pray for them,
unworthy though we be. Remember, Lord,
our fathers and brethren who have fallen
asleep before us, and give them rest under
the light of Thy countenance. Remember,
Lord, our captive brethren, and deliver
them from every misfortune. Remember,
Lord, those who bear fruit and do good
works in Thy holy churches, and grant
them all their petitions for salvation and
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
eternal life. Remember us also, Lord, Thy
humble, sinful, and unworthy servants.
Enlighten our minds with the light of Thy
reason and direct us onto the path of Thy
commandments, through the prayers of
our most Pure Lady, the Theotokos and
ever-virgin Mary and all Thy Saints, for
blessed art Thou unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<h2>THE THREE CANONS</h2>
<p class="rubric">A tradition has developed in the Church of
reading three (sometimes four) Canons the evening
before receiving Holy Communion. Many monastic
Rules of Prayer prescribe this reading daily. Many
Canons have been composed over the years, and certain
Canons are prescribed for specific days of the
week. We have not attempted to publish a large
selection of Canons in the limited space of what is,
essentially, a &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; Prayer Book. We have provided
three of the most commonly used Canons and
printed them in the order in which they are traditionally
read. This order can also serve as a model
for combining other Canons. If these Canons are not
read during Compline (p. 37), they are preceded by
the Opening Prayers and Psalm 50 (pp. 37 to 41).</p>

I therefore call out to Thee:
Glory to Thy power, O Lord!</p>
<p class="rx">Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.</p>

<p>Do not judge me unworthy to receive

<h3 class="ode">ODE 7</h3>
<p class="irmos">Irmos: The most wise youths would not
serve the golden idol, but walked
into the flames themselves, scorning

amid the flames and an Angel
bedewed them with the words:

heard.</p>
<p class="rx">Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.</p>
<p>May this communion of Thine immortal

<p>O God, my Savior, allow me in my present

Behold: emboldened by Thy mercy, I eat
Thy Flesh and drink Thy Blood.</p>
<p class="rx">Let us bless the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the Lord; now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>

Blood and become incorruptible?</p>
<h3 class="ode">ODE 9</h3>
<p class="irmos">Irmos: Our God and Lord, the Son of the
Eternal Father, revealed Himself
to us. He was incarnate of a

those in darkness and gather
those who were scattered. We
therefore magnify the all-hymned

Who, having once offered Himself as an
offering to His Father, is forever immolated,
sanctifying communicants.</p>
<p class="rx">Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.</p>
<p>May I be sanctified in soul and body,
Master! May I be enlightened! May I be
saved! May I become Thy dwelling

Mysteries, having Thee living in me with
the Father and the Spirit, O Most Merciful
Benefactor!</p>
<p class="rx">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.</p>

humanity.</p>

<h4>1st Prayer, of Saint Basil the Great.</h4>
<p>O Lord and Master, Jesus Christ our
God, the Fountain of life and immortality,
the Creator of everything visible and invisible,
the eternal and everlasting Son of
the eternal Father: Thou hast come in
these latter days because of the abundance
of Thy goodness. Thou hast put on
our human flesh and wast crucified and
buried for us thankless and graceless men,
and through Thine own blood Thou hast
renewed our human nature which is corrupted
by sin. And now, O Immortal King,
accept the repentance of me a sinner, and
incline Thine ear to me and listen to my
words:</p>
<p>I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned
before heaven and before Thy face, and I
am not worthy to look upon the height of
Thy Glory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>I have provoked Thy goodness, I have
transgressed Thy commandments, I have
not obeyed Thy statutes.</p>
<p>But, O Lord, since Thou dost not
remember evil, but art long-suffering and
of great mercy, Thou hast not given me
over to destruction for my lawlessness,
but hast ever awaited my conversion.</p>
<p>O Lover of mankind, Thou hast said by
Thy prophets: &ldquo;I have no pleasure in the
death of the wicked, but that the wicked
turn from his way and live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Thou dost not wish, O Master, that
the work of Thy hands should perish,
neither dost Thou take pleasure in the
destruction of men, but Thou desirest that
all men should be saved and come to the
knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, although I am unworthy
both of heaven and of earth and of this
passing life, having wholly yielded myself
to sin and defiled Thine image, yet being
Thy creature and of Thy making, I do not
despair of my salvation in my wickedness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
But made bold by Thine infinite compassion,
I draw near.</p>
<p>Receive me, O Christ Who lovest
mankind, as Thou didst receive the prostitute,
the thief, the tax-collector and the
prodigal. Take away the heavy burden of
my sins, for Thou takest away the sins of
the world, Thou healest the infirmities of
mankind, Thou callest to Thyself and
givest rest to those who labor and are
heavy laden.</p>
<p>Thou hast not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Cleanse me from every stain of flesh and
spirit. Teach me to fulfill holiness in fear of
Thee, that having the testimony of my
own conscience clean, and having communion
of Thy holy things, I may be united
with Thy Body and Blood and may have
Thee to dwell and abide in me, with the
Father and Thy Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ my God, may the
communion of Thy most pure and life-creating
mysteries not bring me into judgment,
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
nor may I become weak in soul and
body by partaking in an unworthy manner,
but grant me to receive communion of
Thy holy things without condemnation
even to my very last breath, and by them
to receive communion of the Holy Spirit,
provision for the journey of eternal life,
and an acceptable answer at Thy dread
judgment seat; that I, together with all
Thy chosen ones, may also be a partaker
of the incorruptible blessings which Thou
hast prepared for those who love thee, O
Lord, in whom Thou art glorified forever.
Amen.</p>
<h4>2nd Prayer, of St. John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>O Lord my God, I know that I am not
worthy nor sufficiently pleasing that Thou
shouldst come under the roof of the house
of my soul for it is entirely desolate and
fallen in ruin, and Thou wilt not find in me
a place worthy to lay Thy head. But as
Thou didst humble Thyself from on high
for our sake, so now humble Thyself to my
lowliness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>As Thou didst deign to lie in a cavern, in a
manger of dumb beasts, so now deign to
enter into the manger of my beastly soul,
and into my soiled body.</p>
<p>As Thou didst not disdain to enter and to
eat with sinners in the house of Simon the
leper, so now be pleased to enter into the
house of my soul, humble and leprous and
sinful.</p>
<p>As Thou didst not cast away the sinful
woman who came to touch Thee, so have
compassion on me a sinner who comes to
touch Thee.</p>
<p>As Thou didst not abhor the kiss of her
sin-stained and unclean mouth, do not
abhor my mouth, worse stained and more
unclean than hers, nor my stained and
shamed and unclean lips, nor my still more
impure tongue.</p>
<p>But let the fiery coal of Thy most pure
Body and Thy most precious Blood bring
me sanctification, enlightenment and
strengthening of my lowly soul and body,
relief from the burden of my many transgressions,
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
protection against every action
of the devil, repulsion and victory over my
wicked and evil habits, mortification of
my passions, accomplishment of Thy commandments,
increase of Thy divine grace,
and inheritance of Thy Kingdom.</p>
<p>For I do not come to Thee in presumption,
O Christ my God, but made bold by
Thine inexpressible goodness, lest I stray
far away from Thy flock, O Master, and
become caught by the wolf of souls.</p>
<p>Therefore, I pray Thee, O Master, for
Thou alone art holy: sanctify my soul and
body, my mind and heart, my muscles and
bones. Renew me entirely. Implant Thy
fear in my fleshly members and let Thy
sanctification never be removed from me.</p>
<p>Be my helper and defender, guide my
life in peace and make me worthy to stand
at Thy right hand with all Thy saints.</p>
<p>By the prayers and supplications of Thy
most pure Mother, of Thy spiritual servants,
the most pure angelic powers, and
of all the saints who have been well-pleasing
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
to Thee. Amen.</p>
<h4>3rd Prayer, of St. Simeon Metaphrastes</h4>
<p>O only pure and incorruptible Lord!
Because of the inexpressible mercy of Thy
love for mankind, Thou didst take to
Thyself our entire human composition
from the pure blood of the Virgin who
gave birth to Thee beyond nature, by the
descent of the Holy Spirit and the good-will
of the ever-existing Father.</p>
<p>O Christ Jesus, Wisdom of God and
Peace and Power, through the human
nature which Thou didst take to Thyself,
Thou didst suffer the life-creating and saving
passion: the Cross, the nails, the
spear&mdash;death itself. Put to death in me
the soul-destroying passions of the body.</p>
<p>Through Thy burial Thou didst capture
the kingdom of death. Bury in me the evil
devices of the devil with good thoughts,
and destroy the spirits of evil.</p>
<p>Through Thy life-bringing Resurrection
Thou didst raise up the first father who
had fallen. Raise me up who am sunk down
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
in sin and give me the image of repentance.</p>
<p>Through Thy glorious Ascension Thou
didst deify the flesh which Thou didst
assume, and placed it on the throne at the
Father&rsquo;s right hand. Grant me to receive a
place at the right hand with the saved
through communion of Thy holy
mysteries.</p>
<p>Through the coming of Thy Spirit, the
Comforter, Thou didst make Thy consecrated
disciples to be honorable vessels.
Show me also to be the receptacle of His
coming.</p>
<p>Thou hast promised to come again to
judge the world in righteousness. Grant
that I may go to meet Thee in the clouds,
my Judge and Creator, with all Thy
saints; that I may glorify and praise Thee
without end, together with Thy Father
Who is without beginning, and Thy most
holy and good and life-creating Spirit, now
and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>4th Prayer, of St. John of Damascus</h4>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>O Lord and Master Jesus Christ our
God, Who alone hast power to absolve
men from their sins, for Thou art good and
lovest mankind: forgive all my transgressions
done in knowledge or in ignorance,
and make me worthy without condemnation
to have communion of Thy divine and
glorious and pure and life-creating
mysteries. Let them not be for my punishment,
or for the increase of my sins. But
let them be for my purification and sanctification,
as a promise of the life and
Kingdom to come, a defense and a help
and a repulsion of every attacker and the
removal of my many transgressions. For
Thou art a God of mercy and generosity
and love for mankind, and to Thee we
ascribe glory, with the Father and the
Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of
ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>5th Prayer, of St. Basil the Great</h4>
<p>I know, O Lord, that I have communion
unworthily of Thy most pure Body and
Thy most precious Blood, and that I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
guilty and drink condemnation to myself
not discerning Thy Body and Blood, O my
Christ and God. But daring upon Thy
generous loving-kindness I come to Thee
Who hast said: &ldquo;He who eats my flesh and
drinks my blood abides in me and I in
him.&rdquo; Be merciful, therefore, O Lord, and
do not rebuke me, a sinner, but deal with
me according to Thy mercy, and let Thy
holy things be for my purification and
healing, for enlightenment and protection,
for the repulsion of every tempting
thought and action of the devil which
works spiritually in my fleshly members.
Let them be for boldness and love for
Thee, for the correction and grounding of
my life, for the increase of virtue and
perfection, for the fulfillment of Thy commandments,
for the communion of the
Holy Spirit, for the journey of eternal life,
for a good and acceptable answer at Thy
dread judgment, but not for judgment or
condemnation. Amen.</p>

<h4>7th Prayer, of St. John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>O God, absolve, remit and pardon me
my transgressions&mdash;as many sins as I
have committed by word or action or
thought, willingly or unwillingly, consciously
or unconsciously; forgive me
everything since Thou art good and lovest
mankind. And by the prayers of Thy most
pure Mother, of Thy spiritual servants,
the holy angelic powers and all the saints,
who from all ages have been well-pleasing
to Thee, be pleased to allow me to receive
Thy most pure Body and Thy most
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
precious Blood for the healing of my soul
and body, and the purification of my evil
thoughts. For Thine is the Kingdom and
the power and the glory with the Father
and the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>8th Prayer, of St. John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>I am not worthy, Master and Lord, that
Thou shouldst enter under the roof of my
soul; yet inasmuch as Thou desirest to live
in me as the Lover of mankind, I approach
with boldness. Thou hast commanded:
Let the doors be opened which Thou alone
hast made and Thou shalt enter with Thy
love for mankind just as Thou art. Thou
shalt enter and enlighten my darkened
reasoning. I believe that Thou wilt do this.
For Thou didst not cast away the prostitute
who came to Thee with tears,
neither didst Thou turn away the tax-collector
who repented, nor didst Thou reject
the thief who acknowledged Thy
Kingdom, nor didst Thou forsake the
repentant persecutor, the Apostle Paul,
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
even as he was. But all who came to Thee
in repentance Thou didst unite to the
ranks of Thy friends, Who alone art blessed
forever, now and unto the endless ages.
Amen.</p>
<h4>9th Prayer, of St. John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ my God, absolve,
loose, cleanse and forgive me Thy sinful
and useless and unworthy servant my errors,
transgressions and sinful failing as
many as I have committed from my youth
up to this present day and hour, consciously
and unconsciously, in words or
actions or reasonings, thoughts, pursuits
and in all my senses. By the prayers of
Thy Mother the most pure and ever-virgin
Mary who gave birth to Thee without
human seed, my only hope which will not
put me to shame, my intercessor and
salvation, grant me to have communion
without condemnation of Thy most pure,
immortal, life-creating and awesome
mysteries; for the remission of sins and
unto life everlasting; for sanctification,
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
enlightenment, strength, healing and
health of soul and body; for the most
perfect removal and destruction of my evil
thoughts and reasonings and intentions,
fantasies by night, brought by dark and
evil spirits; for Thine is the Kingdom and
the power and the glory and the honor and
the worship with the Father and Thy Holy
Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of
ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>10th Prayer, of St. John of Damascus</h4>
<p>I stand before the doors of Thy temple,
and I do not forsake my wicked thoughts.
But, O Christ my God, as Thou hast
justified the tax-collector, and hast had
mercy on the woman of Canaan and hast
opened the gates of paradise to the thief,
open to me the interior depths of Thy love
for mankind and receive me as I come and
repent before Thee. Receive me as Thou
didst receive the sinful woman and the
woman with the flow of blood. For the first
embraced Thy most pure feet and received
the forgiveness of her sins, and the second
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
just touched the hem of Thy garment and
received healing. But I who am lost, daring
to receive Thy whole Body, may I not
be burned; but receive me as Thou hast
received them, and enlighten my spiritual
senses, burning up my spiritual faults by
the prayers of her who gave birth to Thee
without human seed, and of the heavenly
angelic powers, for Thou art blessed unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<h4>Another Prayer of St. John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>I believe, O Lord, and I confess that
Thou art truly the Christ, the Son of the
living God Who earnest into the world to
save sinners, of whom I am first. I believe
also that this is truly Thine own most pure
Body, and that this is truly Thine own
precious Blood. Therefore, I pray Thee:
have mercy upon me and forgive my transgressions
both voluntary and involuntary,
of word and of deed, committed in
knowledge or in ignorance. And make me
worthy to partake without condemnation
of Thy most pure Mysteries, for the remission
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of my sins, and unto life everlasting.
Amen.</p>
<p class="rubric">As you approach to partake, say silently the
following verses of Metaphrastes:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Behold: I draw near to the Divine Communion.</p>
<p class="t2">Burn me not as I partake, O Creator,</p>
<p class="t0">For Thou art a Fire which burns the unworthy.</p>
<p class="t2">Rather, cleanse me of all defilement.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Then say:</p>
<p>Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God,
accept me this day as a communicant; for
I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine
enemies, neither like Judas will I give
Thee a kiss; but like the thief will I confess
Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy
Kingdom.</p>
<p class="rubric">And the following verses:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be awed, O man, when you see the deifying Blood!</p>
<p class="t2">It is a fire which burns the unworthy!</p>
<p class="t0">The Divine Body both deifies and nourishes me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p class="t2">It deifies the spirit and wondrously nourishes the mind.</p>
</div>
<p class="rubric">Then, the following Troparia:</p>
<p>With love hast Thou drawn me, O
Christ, and with Thy divine love hast
Thou changed me. Burn away my sins
with a spiritual fire and satisfy me with
joy in Thee, that I may joyfully magnify
Thy two comings, O Good One.</p>
<p>How shall I, who am unworthy, enter into
the radiance of Thy saints? If I dare to
enter the bridal-chamber, my garment accuses
me, for it is not a wedding garment,
and the angels will bind me and cast me
out. Cleanse, O Lord, the filth of my soul
and save me, for Thou lovest mankind.</p>
<p class="rubric">And this prayer:</p>
<p>O Master Who lovest mankind! O Lord
Jesus Christ my God! May these holy
things not be to my condemnation, though
I am unworthy of them. May they be for
the cleansing and sanctification of my soul
and body and a pledge of the life and
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Kingdom that are to come.</p>
<p>It is good for me to cleave to God and to
place in the Lord the hope of my salvation</p>
<p class="rubric">Then repeat:</p>
<p>Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God,
accept me this day as a communicant; for
I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine
enemies, neither like Judas will I give
Thee a kiss; but like the thief will I confess
Thee: remember me, O Lord, in Thy Kingdom.</p>

<h2>PRAYERS OF THANKSGIVING AFTER COMMUNION</h2>
<p>Glory to Thee, O God! Glory to Thee, O
God! Glory to Thee, O God!</p>
<p>I thank Thee, O Lord my God, for Thou
hast not rejected me, a sinner, but hast
made me worthy to be a partaker of Thy
holy things. I thank Thee, for Thou hast
permitted me, the unworthy, to commune
of Thy most pure and heavenly Gifts. But,
O Master, Who lovest mankind, Who for
our sakes didst die and rise again, and
gavest us these awesome and life-creating
Mysteries for the good and sanctification
of our souls and bodies; let them be for the
healing of soul and body, the repelling of
every adversary, the illumining of the eyes
of my heart, the peace of my spiritual
powers, a faith unashamed, a love unfeigned,
the fulfilling of wisdom, the observing
of Thy commandments, the receiving of
Thy Divine Grace, and the attaining of
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Thy Kingdom. Preserved by them in Thy
holiness, may I always remember Thy
Grace and live not for myself alone, but for
Thee, our Master and Benefactor. May I
pass from this life in the hope of eternal
life, and so attain to the everlasting rest,
where the voice of those who feast is
unceasing, and the gladness of those who
behold the goodness of Thy countenance
is unending. For Thou art the true desire
and the ineffable joy of those who love
Thee, O Christ our God, and all creation
sings of Thy praise forever. Amen.</p>
<h4>A Prayer of Saint Basil the Great</h4>
<p>O Master Christ our God, King of the
Ages, Maker of all things: I thank Thee
for all the good things Thou hast given
me, especially for the communion with
Thy most pure and life-creating
Mysteries. I pray Thee, O gracious Lover
of Man: preserve me under Thy protection,
beneath the shadow of Thy wings.
Enable me even to my last breath, to partake
worthily and with a pure conscience
of Thy holy things, for the remission of
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
sins and unto life eternal. For Thou art the
Bread of Life, the Fountain of Holiness,
the Giver of all Good; to Thee we ascribe
glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit,
now and ever and unto ages of ages.
Amen.</p>
<h4>A Prayer by Saint Simeon Metaphrastes</h4>
<p>Freely Thou hast given me Thy Body
for my food, O Thou Who art a fire consuming
the unworthy. Consume me not, O
my Creator, but instead enter into my
members, my veins, my heart. Consume
the thorns of my transgressions. Cleanse
my soul and sanctify my reasonings. Make
firm my knees and body. Illumine my five
senses. Nail me to the fear of Thee.
Always protect, guard, and keep me from
soul-destroying words and deeds. Cleanse
me, purify me, and adorn me. Give me
understanding and illumination. Show me
to be a temple of Thy One Spirit and not
the home of many sins. May every evil
thing, every carnal passion flee from me as
from a fire as I become Thy tabernacle
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
through communion. I offer Thee as intercessors
all the saints: the leaders of the
bodiless hosts, Thy Forerunner, the wise
apostles, and Thy pure and blameless
Mother. Accept their prayers in Thy love,
O my Christ, and make me, Thy servant, a
child of light. For Thou art the only Sanctification
and Light of our souls, O Good
One, and to Thee, our Master and God, we
ascribe glory day by day.</p>
<h4>Another Prayer</h4>
<p>O Lord Jesus Christ our God: let Thy
holy Body be my eternal life; Thy precious
Blood, my remission of sins. Let this
Eucharist be my joy, health, and gladness.
Make me, a sinner, worthy to stand on the
right hand of Thy glory at Thine awesome
second Coming, through the prayers of
Thy most pure Mother and of all the
saints.</p>
<h4>A Prayer to the Theotokos</h4>
<p>O most holy Lady Theotokos, the light
of my darkened soul, my hope, my protection,
my refuge, my rest, and my joy: I
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
thank you, for you have permitted me, the
unworthy, to be a partaker of the most
pure Body and precious Blood of your
Son. Give the light of understanding to
the eyes of my heart, you that gave birth
to the True Light. Enliven me who am
deadened by sin, you that gave birth to
the Fountain of Immortality. Have mercy
on me, O loving Mother of the merciful
God. Grant me compunction and contrition
of heart, humility in my thoughts,
and a release from the slavery of my own
reasonings. And enable me, even to my
last breath, to receive the sanctification of
the most pure Mysteries, for the healing of
soul and body. Grant me tears of repentance
and confession, that I may glorify
you all the days of my life, for you are
blessed and greatly glorified forever.
Amen.</p>
<p>Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace, according to Thy word.
For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,
which Thou hast prepared before the face
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
of all people: a light to enlighten the Gentiles
and to be the glory of Thy people,
Israel.</p>
<p>Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal!
Have mercy on us. <span class="rubric">(3 times)</span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>O most-holy Trinity, have mercy on us!
O Lord, cleanse us from our sins! O
Master, pardon our transgressions! O
Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities,
for Thy name&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy! <span class="rubric">(3 times)</span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed
be Thy name, Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread; and
forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us; and lead us
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil.</p>
<p class="rubric">(If there is a priest, he adds the usual exclamation.)</p>
<h4>At the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom</h4>
<p>Grace shining forth from your lips like a
beacon has enlightened the universe. It
has shown to the world the riches of poverty.
It has revealed to us the heights of
humility. Teaching us by your words, O
Father John Chrysostom, intercede before
the Word, Christ our God, to save our
souls.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p>You received Divine Grace from
Heaven, all blessed and venerable John
Chrysostom, and taught all by your
mouth to worship one God in the Trinity.
We praise you worthily, for you are an instructor
who reveals things divine.</p>
<p class="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<h4>At the Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great</h4>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Your proclamation has gone out into all
the earth, for it was divinely taught by
hearing your voice. You expounded the
nature of creatures and ennobled the manners
of men. O holy father of royal
priesthood, entreat Christ God that our
souls may be saved.</p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p>You were revealed as the sure foundation
of the Church, granting all men a lord-ship
which cannot be taken away, sealing
it with your precepts, O venerable and
heavenly father.</p>
<p class="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<h4>At the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts
<br />Troparion of Saint Gregory the Dialogist</h4>
<p>The truth of things revealed you to your
flock as a rule of faith, an Icon of
meekness, and a teacher of abstinence.
You thus reached the heights through
humility and wealth through poverty. O
holy hierarch, father Gregory, pray to
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Christ God for the salvation of our souls.</p>
<p class="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Steadfast protectress of Christians, constant
advocate before the Creator: do not
despise the cry of us sinners, but in your
goodness come speedily to help us who call
on you in faith. Hasten to hear our petition
and to intercede for us, O Theotokos,
for you always protect those who honor you.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy! <span class="rubric">(12 times)</span></p>
<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto

<p>More honorable than the Cherubim, and
more glorious beyond compare than the
Seraphim: without defilement you gave
birth to God the Word. True Theotokos,
we magnify you.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
